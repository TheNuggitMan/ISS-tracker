# ISS-tracker (International Space Station)
This was not as simple as it looks. . .  Especially as my original API source was broken, which ended up being basically impossible to fetch!

A one page site where you can see the current location of the ISS in real time, and also change the units from Kilometers to Miles (and back).

It uses JS Fetch to grab the API and the promise is handled in a .then creating a JSON file of the data for me to handle this end and display the data I needed.
